  I guess it can't be truly miscellaneous because there is essentially

-- | Chunkable allows an ordered container of things to be chunked
-- into a list of smaller versions of that thing, each containing N of
-- them instead of the full amount. The final item may contain fewer.
-- That is to say, a list of integers can be transformed into a list
-- of lists of 8 integers each, etc.
